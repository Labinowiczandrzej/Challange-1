# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
I am taking the data provided from the kickstarter worksheet and analyzing specific content within that. The assignment is to compare how plays faired in their fundraising as I am tasked to compare the outcomes based on the launch dates and their fundraising goals. To accomplish this assignment I will be going through two different data visulizations and drawing my conclusions from my findings.

### Purpose
To compare how the other plays performed based on when they were launched and what their goals were.
## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
