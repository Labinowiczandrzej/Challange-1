# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
I am taking the data provided from the kickstarter worksheet and analyzing specific content within that. The assignment is to compare how plays faired in their fundraising as I am tasked to compare the outcomes based on the launch dates and their fundraising goals. To accomplish this assignment I will be going through two different data visulizations and drawing my conclusions from my findings.

### Purpose
To compare how the other plays performed based on when they were launched and what their goals were.
## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Looking over the grand totals of data you can tell that there is no real correlation with the time of year and when programs were launched. As you seperate the data you can see a spike in successful programs starting in May. Afterwards you see a consistent decline until September with a small resurge until a strong drop off in December. When looking at failed there is a high number in the beginning of the year, but afterwards the data shows an almost flat change overall with a small drop in the later part of the year. With canceled projects there isn't much vaiance. The number stays consistant throughout the year. This is all compliled from all the parent categories and not filtered down to just plays. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Looking at the goals based off $5000 dollar intervals we seperate the data into consumable pieces and specifically looking at the plays. The biggest thing that comes out looking at the data is that there were no canceled plays regardless of goals. It also quite apparent that as the goal grows larger that there are less plays and there is an outlier when looking at the goal greater than 50000. The final goal category has a large number of plays and also has a small number of successful outcomes. As a matter of fact it has the highest number of failed outcomes. 
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The challenges faced in the launch date pivot table was organizing the pivot table with the appropriate filters. As well as removing the quarters seperation of data from the table. The Dates had to be convereted from the original given data so that it can be analyzed based of months and years. 
The biggest challanges I faced in the outcomes by goals was first pulling the count ifs data from the kickstarter data and making sure that it is accurate. I was able to double check by adding filters to the original data to see if the numbers matched up. Afterwards it was a matter of organizing the formula correctly based off what the goal was. 
## Results

- *What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
- I can conclude that fundraising that were started during the summer months had the most success while December held a low success rate. 

- *What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
- My conclusion based off what I can see in the data set is that it is more successful to keep your goal under 50000 as it is almost certain to fail passed that point.

- *What are some limitations of this dataset?
- In the launch date data you are not comparing based off the total number or looking at the percentages so you can have higher numbers, but this could also relate to a higher number of programs started at that time. The same can be said for the low points in the dataset. 
- In the out come based by goals I would say that sample size of goals is handicapped with a majority of the data labeled over 50000 and we cannot see what is happening in that area as it is all compliled together. You do have the benefit of the percentages better than the launch dates. The data is overall top and bottom heavy with little counted out in the middle of the compiled data.

- *What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
- Since we are doing a comparison it would be valuable to orgainze the data into column charts or even a table with embedded charts. 
- Even a pie chart can be used to look at the percentages of outcomes based off goals.
